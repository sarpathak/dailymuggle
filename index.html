            <h1> Andrej Karpathy Trains GPT-2 in Pure C</h1>
            <p class="date">April 10, 2024</p>
            <p>Andrej Karpathy, a prominent figure in the field of artificial intelligence, has made a noteworthy contribution with his recent project, llm.c. This project breaks away from the conventional methods of training large language models (LLMs) and offers a unique approach: training a GPT-2 model entirely in C, bypassing the popular deep learning framework, PyTorch. It's efficient and portable due to C's nature but it can be complex for larger models and lacks the functionality of established libraries.        </p>
